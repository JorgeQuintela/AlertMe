# AlertMe

Designed to be a Stock Watch app, you would be able to create a watchlist of the tickers you are interested in.

The app would have an home screen widget for quick access with the most crucial information, so you don't miss a second before spending money on a company that's about to go -90% in two days.

There would also be a Faux trading, where you can spand faux dollars on stock and see how that investment would have paid out. This is where you invested on the company that went +500%.

The monetization of the app would essentially be a small constant banner taking a small portion of the screen.
