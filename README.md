# AlertMe

React Native App designed to be a Stock Watch application, you would be able to create a watchlist of the tickers you are interested in.

The app would have an home screen widget for quick access with the favorited stocks, so you don't miss a second before spending money on a company that's about to go -90% in one day.

There would also be a Faux trading, where you can spend faux dollars on stock and see how that investment would have paid out. This is where you invested on the company that went +500%.

The monetization of the app would essentially be a small, constant, banner of ads taking a small portion of the bottom of the screen.
